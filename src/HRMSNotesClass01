TestNG Class 05
HRMS class 01
January 9, 2020

Constants = final, and cannot be changed

for testers it used
1. create a project structure test.java --> java related code\test/resources -> resouces we used to test

2. manage project dependiencies

POM is design pattern

US 8787: admin user should be able to login into HRMS.

Maven is build automation tool.
TestNG = testing tool.
POM = design pattern to manage/maintain page object elements.
We add dependencies POM.xml = xml file has its own tag. It serves as a configuration file.
we added
selenium
testng
common-io
apache poi

We take these dependencies from Maven repository. Repository is central repository,
it is centralized and everybody has an access.
How we implement our page object model: with page factory and @Find by annotations.

Utility folders, what we have in it = common methods,
in common methods we are creating re-usable methods and functions that deal with our webapplication.
we have configs.reader = we develop functions that specifially work with our property file.
Constants = we specify constants variables.

US 987987 admin user should be able to add an employee to the hrms application

Acceptance Criteria

1. When user enters valid/invalid username and invalid/valid password then display "Invalid credentials"
2. When user leaves password passwrod file empty then display "Password cannot be empty"
3. When user leaves username filed empty then display "Username cannot be empty"

What is DataProvider = it is annotaed method that returns an object of 2 dimensional array.

HOW TO GET ENTIRE DATA FROM EXCEL FILE:

1. FileInputStream (path to the file)
2. Object of XSSFWorkbook (fis)
3. getSheet(name or index);
4. get number of rows getPhysicalNumberOfRows()
5. get number of rows getPhysicalNumberOfCell()
6. create 2 nested for loop
    outer loop -- > control rows
    inner lop --> control cols

7. getRow(index).getCell(index).toString();

List Collection is ordered collection
ArrayLlist = is good for retrieving values, is best for accessing elements inside the collection.
LinkedList = is good choice to add, to delete, is better for manipulation with data for adding and deleting.

to get rows we loop and we start from index 1, because 0 is our key
